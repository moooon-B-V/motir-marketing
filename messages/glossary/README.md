# Catalogue glossaries

> **A MIRROR — edit these in motir-core, never here.** The glossaries are
> motir-core's (`messages/glossary/`), and motir.co translates under the same
> terms so a reader moving between the two sites meets the same words. Refresh
> the mirror with `pnpm i18n:glossary-sync --from <a motir-core checkout>`,
> which copies the files byte for byte and rewrites the line below (MOTIR-7949).

One file per language, holding the **terms** every catalogue in that language
is translated under. `messages/en.json` is the source of truth for what the app
says; these files fix **which words** each language uses for Motir's own nouns,
so the person adding a key next year writes the same word the catalogue already
uses. (Story MOTIR-7730 · MOTIR-7744.)

The files live in this subdirectory on purpose: catalogues are addressed as
`messages/${locale}.json`, so a file here is never mistaken for a catalogue.

## The file shape

The catalogue script (`scripts/i18n/`) loads and validates exactly this shape:

```json
{
  "locale": "ja",
  "register": { "formality": "…", "quotes": "「」", "note": "…" },
  "terms": {
    "work item": {
      "translation": "…",
      "banned": ["…"],
      "allowedSenses": "…",
      "source": "<url or product + surface>",
      "note": "…"
    },
    "Motir": { "translation": "Motir", "doNotTranslate": true }
  }
}
```

- `locale` equals the file name.
- `register` records the formality, the quotation marks, and how punctuation,
  a sentence-final `…` and a `{placeholder}` in running text are written.
- `terms` is keyed by the English term, and **every file carries the same key
  set**. Each term has a `translation` and a `source` saying where it was
  checked; `note` says why, and says so when no reference could be reached.

## The rules every catalogue follows

- **Never translated, in any language:** `Motir`, `Motir AI` (both
  `doNotTranslate`), and `Sprint`, which stays in Latin script everywhere —
  including Japanese and Korean, whose Jira write スプリント / 스프린트. That is a
  recorded decision, not an oversight.
- **The product noun is "work item"** — one term per language — and **never**
  that language's word for "issue" or "card". Each file's `work item.banned`
  lists those words. "Card" stays correct for a **payment card** and a **UI
  panel**; `allowedSenses` says so.
- **A new catalogue key is translated under these terms.** When you add a key
  to `messages/en.json`, its ten translations use the words recorded here. If a
  term is missing or wrong, change it here first, in the same pull request, and
  say why in its `note`.
