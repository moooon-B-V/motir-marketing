/*
 * MOTIR-4990 — a design asset is a REFERRER, ported from motir-core's
 * `tests/design-asset-addresses.test.ts` (MOTIR-2316, MOTIR-2364).
 *
 * ── Why this repository needs it now ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The `/docs` design of record lives here (MOTIR-3932, MOTIR-4393), and the
 * design-reference rule makes an asset AUTHORITATIVE: a card building a surface
 * opens `design/<area>/` first and matches what it finds. So an address an
 * asset names is believed by construction, and so is a source path it tells
 * the next agent to open. Neither is resolved by any build, and neither is
 * opened by any other test — both live only in prose and in `href`s.
 *
 * ── The two sweeps ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  1. ADDRESSES — every `/…` an asset names must still be a page this app
 *     serves: the `app/**` route tree, plus any redirect `next.config.ts`
 *     declares (checked FIRST — a redirect source resolves, but only by
 *     sending the reader somewhere else).
 *  2. SOURCE PATHS — every path anchored on one of this repository's own
 *     top-level directories must exist in the tree.
 *
 * ── Where the judgement went ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One place per sweep: `KNOWN` and `KNOWN_PATHS`. An asset can name an address
 * on purpose that this app does not serve — another host's route, a
 * point-in-time record — and each such pair is listed once with a reason. Both
 * tables are asserted TIGHT in both directions: an unlisted finding fails, and
 * a row that no longer matches anything fails too, so neither can rot into a
 * mute button.
