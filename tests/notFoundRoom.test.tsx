/*
 * THE 404 ROOM (MOTIR-4193) — the jsdom half.
 *
 * `e2e/specs/not-found.spec.ts` is the half that matters most, because the two
 * things that card is really about — that the response is a REAL 404 and that
 * the DOM carries exactly one landmark once Next has resolved the boundary —
 * are properties of a served document and cannot be observed here.
 *
 * What this file covers is the half a browser lane pays two minutes of build
 * time to reach: that the room reads its words from the CATALOGUE rather than
 * from the JSX, that its doors are built from the shipped constants, and that
 * the room renders no `<main>` of its own. Each of those is a rule the design
 * asset states and a later edit could quietly break with every browser
 * assertion still green.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THE DOORS ARE ABSOLUTE NOW, ON EVERY HOST (MOTIR-4430) ─────────────
 *
 * That is a deliberate change to what `motir.co` itself emits, and it is here
 * rather than buried: the room is worn by every host `proxy.ts` serves, and
 * `app/not-found.tsx` is the one document that may not ask which one it is on —
 * a `headers()` read in the global not-found boundary makes the WHOLE SITE
 * dynamic. So the room links absolutely, which is the only spelling that works
 * off the site and the same destination on it. What it costs on `motir.co` is
 * the client transition off a 404 page. The file's own header carries the route
 * tables and the two alternatives that were built and measured out.
