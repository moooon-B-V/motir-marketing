 * tidiness: the source repository's own card was written for SIX documents,
 * `model-providers.md` was added days later, and a hardcoded list of six would
 * have shipped a subprocessor page linking to a 404 — disclosing LESS than it
 * did before. So the guard is over the REAL directory, and it is what makes a
 * new document a file drop rather than an edit in four places.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS DRIVEN THROUGH THE REAL LOADER, not a fixture of one hand-written
 * document. That is the seam a unit test mocks away and the one that actually
 * broke: a document added and a route table not updated. A fixture cannot fail
 * that way.

/**
 * ── ⚠️ NO LEGAL LINK IS A PATH THIS HOST DOES NOT SERVE (MOTIR-4147) ────────
 *
 * The Privacy Policy's §7 linked to `/settings/account/data` — the account
 * pane where a reader exercises their GDPR Art. 15/17 rights. That path was
 * correct while these documents lived on `app.motir.co` and is a 404 here, so
 * the one sentence in the policy that tells a reader HOW to exercise a right
 * pointed at nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FIXED LINK IS NOT THE DELIVERABLE — THIS GUARD IS. One link says
 * nothing about the next document, and the class is easy to re-enter: every
 * one of these files was written for a host that served the whole product,
 * so a bare path READS correct to whoever writes the next one.
 *
 * The population is the SHIPPED body — `listLegalDocuments()` after
 * `expandDestinations`, which is the text a reader's browser receives — not
 * the raw file. That matters in both directions: a `{{TOKEN}}` is judged by
 * what it RESOLVES to, and an unresolved one cannot hide behind "it is only a
 * placeholder".
 *
 * The servable shapes, and there are exactly four:
 *
 *   - `/legal/<slug>` where the slug is a document ON DISK — this host serves
 *     it, and the slug is checked rather than the shape, so a link to a
 *     document that does not exist is as red as a link to another host's path.
 *   - an absolute `https?://` URL — it names its own host, whichever that is.
 *   - `mailto:` — already in the set (`content/legal/dpa.md`), and it leaves
 *     the browser rather than this origin.
 *   - `#anchor` — in-page, resolved against whatever URL is showing it.
 *
 * Anything else is a link this site cannot serve.
