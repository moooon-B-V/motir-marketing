/*
 * THE SHARED CHROME'S SITE LINKS, ON EACH HOST KIND (MOTIR-4372).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE AXIS THIS FILE ADDS IS THE HOST KIND, NOT THE LINKS. Every link
 * asserted below was already covered — `tests/destinations.test.ts` pins each
 * constant and `tests/siteHeader.test.tsx` asserts the bar emits them — and the
 * whole `origin/main` suite passed with the defect present, because every one of
 * those cases asks the question ON `motir.co`, the one host where the answer was
 * right. The chrome renders byte-identically on a tenant host, where `/explore`,
 * `/docs`, `/design` and all three legal paths are 404s, so the markup a reader
 * compares between the two hosts shows AGREEMENT rather than a bug.
 *
 * `tests/host/tenantLinks.test.tsx` is this file's sibling and covers the
 * mirror question — a PROJECT's own paths on each host kind (`publicPathFor`).
 * Together they are the two halves of the per-host address model: where does a
 * project's page live, and where does the SITE's own page live.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT QUANTIFIES OVER `SITE_PATHS` RATHER THAN NAMING THREE LINKS. The
 * defect was not one wrong href — all seven were wrong, identically — so a test
 * that enumerates a subset proves nothing about the rest, and nothing at all
 * about the eighth site link somebody adds next year.
