/*
 * THE SEAM THE UNITS MOCK (MOTIR-4121).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS AT ALL. Every other test in this directory mocks
 * `fetch` and hands the module a shape someone typed — which means the module
 * and its tests were written from the SAME assumption, and a drift between that
 * assumption and what `motir-core` really returns is invisible to both. This
 * suite drives the RECORDED responses instead, all the way to the props a
 * component receives.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FIXTURES ARE THE BROWSER LANE'S OWN, deliberately — `e2e/fixtures/`,
 * one set, not a second copy that could drift from the first. They are shaped
 * from motir-core's published contract, and the CONTRACT is guarded in the
 * producing repository (`public-surface-hosts.md` §3): a contract test living
 * only in the consumer reports the break after it has shipped. So nothing here
 * asserts the contract — it asserts that OUR module turns the contract's shapes
 * into the props our components render, which is the half that lives here.
