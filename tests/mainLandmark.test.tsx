/*
 * THE `main` LANDMARK, GUARDED BY ENUMERATION (MOTIR-4169).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR IS NOT "eight pages are missing a tag".
 * It is that NOTHING SHARED SUPPLIED ONE, so every page had to remember and
 * most did not — four of twelve routes had a `main` and eight did not. Adding
 * the tag to the eight would have left the thirteenth page with the same hole,
 * which is why the fix moved the landmark into `SiteShell` and why this guard
 * ENUMERATES the route tree from disk instead of listing the routes it knows
 * about. A page added later cannot ship without one, because this test finds
 * the page rather than waiting to be told about it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT SEE, said plainly ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is a STATIC read of the route tree: it resolves each page's layout
 * chain and asks which files in it render a landmark. It cannot see a landmark
 * rendered by some component a page imports, and it does not try — the
 * BEHAVIOURAL half is `e2e/specs/landmark.spec.ts`, which opens every one of
 * these routes in a browser and counts the landmarks the DOM actually has.
 * The two are deliberate halves: the static one is the only one that can ask
 * "does a page EXIST that nobody covered", because a browser needs a URL and a
 * dynamic segment has none until a parameter is supplied. The last `describe`
 * below is the join between them — the pattern set here must be exactly the
 * URL table the browser lane walks.
 *
 * A page.tsx is not the only file Next serves, and the others are deliberately
 * out of scope: `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, `opengraph-image.tsx` and the
 * changelog `route.ts` answer bytes rather than a document, and a landmark is
 * a property of a DOCUMENT.
