 * The pairs this SITE composes. Each names the element it belongs to, because

 *
 * SCOPE: these are the pairs where THIS site picks the ink or the surface. The
 * inks a primitive resolves inside its own box (`Input`'s helper, `Pill`'s
 * status fills) belong to `@motir/design-system` and are gated by motir-core's
 * own `inkContrastLint`, which runs over the same registries.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LIST NOW CARRIES A VERDICT, AND THE `below-AA` HALF IS THE POINT
 * (MOTIR-3984). Until this card every entry meant "the site paints this, and it
 * must clear AA", so the only way to record a pair the site MUST NOT paint was
 * to leave it out — and a pair that is absent from the list is indistinguishable
 * from one nobody thought of. That is exactly how the same defect arrived three
 * times in three days (MOTIR-3874, MOTIR-3931, MOTIR-3984): the muted ink was
 * carried against `--el-card`, the one surface the rail had just moved onto, and
 * against no other, so the matrix was green about a pair the footer was not
 * painting while the pair it WAS painting went unmeasured.
 *
 * So the three muted inks are stated against every surface this site has, and
 * the ones that fail carry `below-AA` rather than being omitted. Two tests read
 * that verdict and they pull in opposite directions: the `below-AA` rows are
 * asserted to be genuinely BELOW AA (so a republish that lifts them turns this
 * file red and the declaration is re-decided instead of quietly rotting into a
 * tautology), and `the site paints nothing below AA` asserts that no rendered
 * element paints one. Neither number is a promise about the theme —
 * `--el-text-muted`'s values belong to motir-core and are deliberate
 * (MOTIR-2455) — they are a promise about what this site puts on top of them.

 * So this describe starts from the ELEMENTS instead. It renders the site's two

 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS ALSO WHY THE MOCK COULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT THIS. An element scan over
