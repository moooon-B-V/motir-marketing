/*
 * The /docs drift guard (MOTIR-4046, widened by MOTIR-4180).
 *
 * `/docs` is generated from TWO of motir-core's registries, and each half is
 * guarded on its own terms.
 *
 * The API reference consumes motir-core's PUBLISHED OpenAPI document — served
 * at the versioned, public `/api/openapi/v1.json`, assembled from compile-time
 * declarations — rather than a copied spec. So the guard is two-fold: the spec
 * is fetched from the published URL (never a committed copy), and the parse the
 * reference renders through is asserted against a fixture, so a shape change in
 * motir-core's registry that breaks the parse fails here rather than silently
 * rendering an empty reference.
 *
 * The MCP TOOL registry is now consumed the same way (MOTIR-4194 / MOTIR-4195).
 * motir-core publishes the catalogue at `/api/docs/mcp-tools.json` — anonymous,
 * derived from the permission registry that gates the tools — and this repository
 * fetches it at request time. MOTIR-4046 had shipped a hand COPY instead: 24 of
 * 55 tools in five invented groups, with no reader and no checker, which is the
 * outcome its own acceptance criterion had already called unacceptable. MOTIR-4180
 * removed it, and the guard below asserts the ABSENCE of any copy.
 *
 * ⚠️ THAT GUARD IS UNCHANGED AND STILL THE POINT. Rendering the catalogue did not
 * weaken it: the names arrive over the wire and are never written into the page
 * source, so the same detector still finds nothing. If it ever goes red, a copy
 * has come back — and the fix is the implementation, never the guard.
 *
 * Both readers are guarded on the same two axes: the URL they fetch is the
 * published one (never a committed file), and the parse each page renders through
 * is pinned against a fixture, so a shape change in motir-core's registry fails
 * here rather than silently rendering an empty page.
