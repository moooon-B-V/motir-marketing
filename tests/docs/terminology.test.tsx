/*
 * THE TERMINOLOGY SWEEP, ON THE RENDER (MOTIR-4508).
 *
 * ── The defect this exists for, which is a GREEN TEST rather than a red one ─
 * `/docs/sandbox` opened with "a container you start on your own machine,
 * holding a coding agent, the Motir CLI and your checkouts". `tests/copy.test.ts`
 * carries a case named *"never says 'coding agent' — agents do all kinds of
 * work"*, and it passed, because it walks `lib/copy` — the catalogue — and this
 * sentence was typed into `app/[locale]/docs/(guides)/sandbox/page.tsx` as JSX prose.
 *
 * The catalogue was once the only place a rendered string could enter. It is not
 * any more: `lib/docs.ts`'s own carve-out makes the guide pages AUTHORED
 * documentation, so `/docs`, `/docs/cli`, `/docs/mcp`, `/docs/mcp/tools`,
 * `/docs/sandbox`, `/docs/public-address` and the three `/docs/api` pages all
 * render sentences no catalogue holds. A guard scoped to the wrong surface is
 * worse than no guard: it converts an open question into a settled one, and the
 * next person to wonder whether the terminology is enforced finds a passing test
 * with the right name and stops looking.
 *
 * ── Why it is not a second `grep` ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The offending source line reads
 *
 *     A sandbox is a container you start on your own machine, holding a coding
 *     agent, the Motir CLI and your checkouts — and nothing else.
 *
 * so `grep -rn "coding agent" app/` returns NOTHING on the unfixed tree. JSX
 * wraps the phrase across two lines and joins it back with a single space when
 * it renders. That is the same trap MOTIR-4369 records about an acceptance
 * criterion that greps for a string JSX line-wraps. A source grep cannot be the
 * check, and `sourceGrepMissesIt` below asserts exactly that rather than
 * asserting it in a comment.
 *
 * ── Why it WALKS rather than lists ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `tests/docs/pageMetadata.test.ts` found its pages instead of naming them for
 * this reason and this file follows it: a page added tomorrow is covered without
 * anybody remembering to add a case. The cost of the other shape is already
 * visible next door — `tests/docs/inlineSpacing.test.tsx` names seven routes and
 * the tree holds nine, so `/docs/mcp/tools` and `/docs/api` have never been
 * checked by it.
 *
 * ── What it does NOT reach, said plainly ────────────────────────────────────
 * It renders the PAGE, not the shell around it. The rail and the site chrome
 * read their strings out of `lib/copy`, which is the surface `tests/copy.test.ts`
 * already sweeps — so the two together cover the page and its frame, and neither
 * is a substitute for the other. This ADDS; it changes nothing in that file.
