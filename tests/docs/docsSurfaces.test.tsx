 * ONE LIST OF WHAT `/docs` CONTAINS (MOTIR-4507).
 *
 * ── The defect ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The index page and the rail each held their own copy of the same fact.
 * MOTIR-4227 added `/docs/public-address`, put it in the rail's `SURFACES` and
 * did not put it on the index — so the one page whose entire content is a list
 * of what this area contains was missing a page, and nothing went red, because
 * neither file knew the other existed.
 *
 * ── Why these assertions WALK rather than LIST ─────────────────────────────
 * A test naming the nine routes is the same defect one level up: the tenth page
 * arrives, the author adds it to the list the test names, and the test agrees
 * with itself. So every check below derives its expectation — from
 * `lib/docsSurfaces.ts`, or from the FILE SYSTEM, which is the only witness
 * that does not participate in the mistake.
