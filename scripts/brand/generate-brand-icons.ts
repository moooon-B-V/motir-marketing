/**
 * Renders motir.co's favicon / app-icon set from the ONE brand path
 * (MOTIR-3847 · motir-core `design/brand/design-notes.md` §5).
 *
 *   node scripts/brand/generate-brand-icons.ts
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS A PORT OF, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT ─────────────────
 *
 * motir-core ships the same set from `scripts/brand/generate-brand-icons.mts`.
 * This is that script, narrowed to the three files THIS site serves and cut
 * over to a different rasteriser. It is a PORT rather than a copy of the
 * outputs: the artwork itself is imported from `@motir/brand`, so there is no
 * second copy of the mark anywhere in this repository — `WAVE_BAND_PATH` and
 * the two baked colour literals arrive from the package, exactly as
 * `public/motir-mark.svg` already takes `waveBandSvg()` from it (MOTIR-1154).
 *
 * What this site does NOT ship, and why the absence is deliberate:
 *
 *   - **No maskable icons and no `app/manifest.ts`.** Those exist so an
 *     "Add to Home Screen" of the APP gets a real tile; a marketing landing is
 *     not installed. `MASKABLE_SCALE` and the 0.8 safe circle are therefore
 *     meaningless here and are not restated — carrying a constant whose only
 *     consumer is absent is how a number drifts unnoticed.
 *   - **No email mark.** This repository sends no email.
 *
 * ⚠️ A MANIFEST-REFERENCED ICON WOULD HAVE TO GO IN `public/`, NEVER
 * `app/icon-<size>.png`. Next's static-metadata matcher takes ONE optional
 * DIGIT after `icon`, so `app/icon-192.png` matches nothing and is served at no
 * URL at all — silently, under a green build. It cost motir-core a 404ing
 * manifest entry (design-notes.md §5). Nothing here trips it, because the two
 * `app/` names below (`icon.svg`, `apple-icon.png`) DO match the convention;
 * the warning is recorded so the next person to add a sized icon reads it
 * before choosing a directory.
 *
 * ── THE RASTERISER: sharp, not Playwright (the decision MOTIR-3847 carried) ──
 *
 * motir-core rasterises with Playwright's chromium, which is already a
 * devDependency THERE. It is not one here, and adding it would put a browser
 * download in front of every `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in a repository
 * whose whole CI is four short jobs — to serve a script CI never runs.
 *
 * `sharp` was already resolved in this repository's lockfile as Next's optional
 * image-optimisation dependency, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` already allow-lists
 * its build. Depending on it explicitly pins the same version that was being
 * fetched anyway, so the icon set costs this repository no new download.
 *
 * It is imported lazily, inside `main()`, so `tests/brand/iconAssets.test.ts`
 * can import the pure helpers without loading a native module.
 *
 * The two engines are not byte-compatible and are not meant to be: what the two
 * properties share is the PATH, the two colour literals and the geometry below,
 * which is what "one source of truth" means for a mark. The committed bytes are
 * pinned by the test against THIS generator, in THIS repository.

 * Glyph box as a fraction of the canvas, for an icon the OS never crops.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS NUMBER IS DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN, AND IT MOVED ONCE ALREADY
 * (MOTIR-3181 · design-notes.md §5). The 24-grid artwork used to carry a
 * ~1-unit inset, so its bounding box was 21.984 of the 24 box. Removing that
 * margin — the fix that made the vertical caps render crisp — makes the glyph
 * span the FULL square, so at any given scale it renders 24 / 21.984 = 9.2%
 * larger. Both of motir-core's scales are divided by that factor to keep the
 * icons the size they already were, which is what turns 0.66 into 0.605.
 *
 * `tests/brand/iconAssets.test.ts` pins that identity rather than the literal,
 * so a re-drawn mark fails here with its arithmetic in front of you.
