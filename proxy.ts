/**
 * THE HOST ROUTER (Story MOTIR-3878 · MOTIR-4220) — this repository's first
 * proxy, and the reason `motir.co`'s renderer can answer for other hosts.
 *
 * Next 16 renamed the `middleware.ts` convention to `proxy.ts` and the export to
 * `proxy` (https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy); `motir-core`'s
 * own file is the shape followed here, including `config.matcher`'s guard.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A request arrives on `acme.motir.site` or on `roadmap.acme.com`. The visitor's
 * URL is the address they typed; the RENDERER has one `/p/[identifier]` tree.
 * This turns the first into the second with a REWRITE — the URL bar does not
 * change, no page is duplicated, and `app/p/**` never learns that it is serving
 * three shapes of address. The two headers it forwards are what a page uses to
 * emit links back at the host it is on (`lib/publicHost.ts`).
 *
 * ── ⚠️ `motir.co` NEVER CALLS THE CONTRACT, AND THAT IS ASSERTED ─────────
 *
 * The site's own host, `localhost` and the loopback addresses leave here on the
 * first branch, before any network hop. Every request to the marketing site —
 * the landing, `/explore`, `/docs`, `/legal` — would otherwise pay a round trip
 * to `app.motir.co` to be told it is not a tenant, on the host whose entire job
 * is to be fast and crawlable. `tests/host/hostRouter.test.ts` asserts the
 * absence with a spy rather than trusting the branch to stay first.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ AN OUTAGE IS NOT A 404 ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * When the contract does not answer, the request is rewritten to
 * `/host-unavailable`, which renders the design's ERROR state
 * (`design/public-projects/` panel 12) in the site chrome. Answering 404 instead
 * would tell a crawler that a customer's domain is gone every time
 * `app.motir.co` restarts — and a crawler acts on a 404. This is
 * `lib/publicProject.ts`'s three-outcome rule, applied one layer earlier.
 *
 * ── BOUNDARY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No canonical, `og:url`, sitemap or robots decision is made here, and no
 * `motir.co/p/*` redirect — those are MOTIR-4222's, over the headers this sets.

 * next-intl's locale router (MOTIR-7948), run on the SITE host only.
 *
 * With `as-needed` it rewrites an unprefixed path onto the English tree
 * (`/explore` → `/en/explore`, the visitor's URL unchanged); any other locale's
 * prefixed path passes straight through. Detection and the cookie are off in
 * `i18n/routing.ts`, so today it never moves a visitor between languages.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ENGLISH TREE ITSELF NEVER REACHES IT, because its rewrite comes back.
 * Next 16 dispatches an internal rewrite back through this proxy (the same
 * second pass `alreadyRouted` handles for tenants), so `/explore` arrives again
 * as `/en/explore` — and next-intl, which cannot tell that from a visitor who
 * typed `/en/explore`, answers it with a redirect to `/explore`. Measured on the
 * standalone server: `/` answered 307 → `/`, forever, and the browser lane never
 * came up. So `/en` and `/en/…` are served as they are. A visitor who types one
 * gets the same page at a second address, which is a duplicate rather than a
 * fault, and the canonical link (MOTIR-7956) names the unprefixed one.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT RUNS INSIDE THE SITE BRANCH, NEVER AHEAD OF THE ROUTER. As a second
 * proxy, or as this proxy's first line, it would rewrite a tenant host's
 * `/MOTIR/board` to `/en/MOTIR/board` before the host was ever resolved — and
