// Inter, for the root `next/og` card (MOTIR-1154 · motir-core
// `design/brand/design-notes.md` §6 "OG template").
//
// `next/og` renders through satori, OUTSIDE the CSS tree: it cannot read
// `--font-sans-source`, cannot see the `next/font` faces `app/layout.tsx`
// loads, and has no system font stack to fall back to. The only way it gets a
// typeface is `ImageResponse`'s `fonts` option, and the only thing that option
// accepts is font BYTES — so the faces are read off disk at request time. A
// template that sets `fontFamily: 'sans-serif'` does not error; it silently
// ships whatever face the build container happens to have, which is exactly the
// defect §6 records against motir-core's own two cards.
//
// ⚠️ THE BYTES COME FROM `@motir/brand` NOW, AND THAT IS THE POINT (MOTIR-3848).
// They used to be committed here AND in motir-core — three binaries,
// byte-identical, with no shared owner, against MOTIR-3724's own ruling that
// Motir's brand chrome has ONE home across both properties. The header that
// stood here recorded the duplication as "a known cost, not an oversight",
// because `@motir/brand` published `dist` + `brand.css` and carried no font
// assets; it now carries them, in `fonts/`, listed in `files` and exposed as
// `@motir/brand/fonts/*`. The reasoning that used to live here — WHY THREE
// FILES (400 / 700 / 800, and satori does not synthesise weight) and WHY `.ttf`
// (satori cannot decompress WOFF2, which is all Google Fonts serves a modern
// browser) — travelled with the bytes, into
// `motir-core/packages/brand/src/ogFonts.ts`.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY SEGMENT OF `FONT_DIR` IS A LITERAL, AND `OG_FONT_FACES` IS A LOCAL
// ARRAY OF LITERALS — BOTH DELIBERATELY, AND THIS IS THE ONE THING THE MOVE
// COULD HAVE BROKEN. `outputFileTracingIncludes` is INERT under Next 16's
// Turbopack build (`collect-build-traces.js` is skipped entirely). What actually
// ships these bytes is Turbopack's own tracer, which follows this read only
// BECAUSE the path is statically analysable — a value returned from a function
// call is not, and its fallback for an unresolvable read is to trace the ENTIRE
// project (motir-core MOTIR-3219: 4510 files, a 464 MB standalone image). That
// is why `@motir/brand` exports a MANIFEST and no path helper, and why this file
// repeats the face list rather than mapping over the imported one.
// `tests/ogFonts.test.ts` pins these literals against the package's.
//
// Verify by grepping the built
// `.next/server/app/[locale]/opengraph-image*/route.js.nft.json` for the file
// names, never by reading the config.
//
// ── THE CJK FACES (MOTIR-7972) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Inter has no Han, kana or Hangul, so a `zh` / `ja` / `ko` card would draw
// tofu — or `next/og` would fetch a fallback face this site never chose. Each
// of those locales gets the DEFAULT sans member of its font set
// (`@motir/design-system`'s `FONT_SET_REGISTRY`: Noto Sans SC / JP / KR) at the
// three weights, as SUBSETS committed in `og-fonts/`: a full Noto Sans JP is
// several MB per weight, the subset a few KB. They are cut by
// `pnpm brand:og-fonts` from exactly the three strings the card draws, and
// `og-fonts/manifest.json` records what each was cut from.
// `tests/ogFonts.test.ts` checks every drawn character against the faces'
// cmaps, so a catalogue edit that outgrows a subset fails CI instead of
// drawing tofu.
//
// ⚠️ ONE EXPLICIT BRANCH PER LOCALE, EACH PATH A LITERAL — the same tracer rule
// as `FONT_DIR` above. A template string over the locale is not statically
// analysable.
