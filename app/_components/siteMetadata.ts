/*
 * The root metadata. MOTIR-1152 shipped the title and description and left the
 * ENTITY SIGNAL to MOTIR-1154 (8.3.7); this is that card, so the rest of it
 * arrives here — `metadataBase`, the canonical, the OpenGraph / Twitter shape
 * that makes `app/opengraph-image.tsx` render as a large card, and the Search
 * Console meta tag. The JSON-LD graph is a `<script>` rather than metadata and
 * is injected in the tree below.
 *
 * ⚠️ `metadataBase` IS THE LOAD-BEARING LINE, AND ITS ABSENCE FAILS QUIETLY.
 * Next injects a file-convention `opengraph-image` as a site-RELATIVE path and
 * resolves it against this value when it writes `<meta property="og:image">`.
 * With none set it falls back to the dev origin and advertises the card at
 * `http://localhost:3000/opengraph-image` — an address no crawler, social-card
 * renderer or link-preview fetcher can reach. motir-core shipped exactly that
 * on its whole public surface until MOTIR-2505, saying so in its logs on every
 * render; this site starts with the line in place.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVALUATED AT BUILD TIME, because this is a static export on a statically
 * rendered route. That is correct for every value here — `SITE_ORIGIN` is a
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` constant and the catalogue is a compiled-in import — but it
 * is also why the verification variable below must be a BUILD arg if it is ever
 * set, never a Fly secret. Same rule, and same reason, as
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOTIR_APP_ORIGIN`.
 */
/*
 * ⚠️ THE CARD IS NAMED EXPLICITLY NOW, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT (MOTIR-7948).
 * `app/opengraph-image.tsx` is a file convention, and Next attaches it to the
 * metadata of the SEGMENT it sits in — the root. While the root layout also
 * declared `openGraph`, that was the same segment, and every page inherited the
 * card. Under `app/[locale]` the locale layout declares its own `openGraph`
 * (for `og:locale`), a child's `openGraph` REPLACES its parent's whole, and the
 * file-based image went with it: a clean build of this branch emitted no
 * `og:image` at all on `/en`, `/en/docs` or `/en/legal/terms`. So the image is
 * named here, at the root route the file serves, in both tag sets.
 */
/*
 * ⚠️ NO CANONICAL HERE ANY MORE (MOTIR-7956). This was `alternates: { canonical:
 * '/' }`, and every page that set none inherited it — so a docs page told a
 * crawler that its canonical was the LANDING. Each page now names its own
 * through `localeMetadata`; a 404 names none, which is right for a 404.
