/**
 * THE 404 ROOM ITSELF (MOTIR-4193), lifted out of `app/not-found.tsx`
 * (MOTIR-4430) so that its host is a PARAMETER rather than a hard-coded
 * `SITE_HOST`.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ WHY IT TAKES A HOST AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The room is worn by every host `proxy.ts` serves, not only by `motir.co`: a
 * tenant address that 404s a path, the tenant base domain, and any host the
 * public contract does not know are all rewritten to `ROUTER_PATHS.notFound`
 * and land here. On those hosts `/explore`, `/docs`, `/design` and the three
 * legal paths are 404s — so a lost visitor was being handed six chrome doors
 * and two room doors that all led back to the room they were standing in.
 * `hey.motir.site/explore` is the reproduction MOTIR-4430 was filed from.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ AND WHY ITS CALLER PASSES {@link UNKNOWN_HOST} RATHER THAN ASKING ──
 *
 * `app/not-found.tsx` may not read the request — it is the GLOBAL not-found
 * boundary, so a `headers()` read there makes the entire application dynamic
 * (measured; that file carries the route tables and the two alternatives that
 * were built and failed). It passes `UNKNOWN_HOST`, whose `kind` is not `site`, which is
 * all `siteLinkFor` needs: every `motir.co` path is spelled absolutely, which
 * is the only spelling that works off the site and the same destination on it.
 *
 * The component is deliberately host-AGNOSTIC, so the day a route can hand it a
 * real `PublicHost` — a nested `not-found.tsx` that may be async, or partial
 * prerendering — the change is one argument and nothing here moves.

            reader of MOTIR-4430 misses. The CHROME's links are what the bug was

            host `/explore` and `/` are that workspace's or that project's own

            Same pair of helpers as the chrome, for the same two reasons:
            `siteLinkFor` spells the href and `ChromeLink` picks the element, so
            off the site both are plain `<a>`s and neither is RSC-prefetched. On
            `motir.co` this is byte-identical to what shipped — a `next/link` to
            `EXPLORE` and one to the site root. */}
