/**
 * THE CHROME EVERY motir.co SURFACE WEARS, AND THE ONE PLACE THE `main`
 * LANDMARK LIVES (MOTIR-4169).
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THE DECISION THIS COMPONENT EXISTS TO MAKE ─────────────────────────
 *
 * MOTIR-4169 asked which of two answers this repository takes, and this is it:
 * **the CHROME owns the landmark, and no page renders its own.** The rejected
 * alternative — the chrome renders a `main` only where a page does not — is
 * not expressible here in any honest way: a layout is rendered BEFORE and
 * AROUND its `children` and cannot inspect what they will produce, so
 * "only where a page does not" would have to be a prop each page passes, which
 * is the same per-page memory that produced the defect, wearing a flag.
 *
 * The defect was exactly that. Four of twelve routes rendered `<main>` in the
 * PAGE and eight did not, because nothing shared supplied one and every page
 * had to remember. A fix that adds the tag to the remaining pages leaves the
 * thirteenth page with the same hole. So the tag moves UP, the four pages that
 * had one give theirs up, and `tests/mainLandmark.test.ts` enumerates the
 * route tree from disk so a page added later cannot ship without one.
 *
 * ── THE SKIP LINK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A landmark with nothing pointing at it is half the bypass mechanism WCAG
 * 2.4.1 asks for, so the affordance ships with it: the FIRST focusable element
 * on every page, invisible until focused, targeting the `main` below.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE RUNG-1 FILL, DECLARED — the same declaration `SiteHeader`'s narrow
 * menu panel makes, for the same reason. `design/public-site/` (motir-core)
 * draws this chrome's bar and footer and depicts no skip link, because it
 * draws what is VISIBLE at rest and this is visible only under focus. It is
 * not invented here either: it is `motir-core`'s shipped
 * `components/ui/AppLayout.tsx` affordance — its markup, its `href="#main"` /
 * `id="main"` pairing and its `sr-only` → `focus:not-sr-only` reveal — reused
 * rather than redrawn, which is the composition rule
 * `design/public-site/design-notes.md` § "Composition, not redrawing" already
 * states for the bar and the footer.
 *
 * The ONE deliberate divergence from that source: the focus ring is
 * `--el-accent-on-surface` rather than motir-core's `--focus-ring-color`,
 * because this repository routes colour through Tier-3 element tokens and that
 * pair is a MEASURED row of `design/marketing/design-notes.md`'s AA table
 * (6.57:1 light / 6.11:1 dark against the page, over 1.4.11's 3:1). The link's
 * own ink is `--el-text` on `--el-page-bg` — 17.40:1 / 17.42:1, the table's
 * first row. Both readings are the table's, not new ones.
 */

/**
 * The landmark's id, and the skip link's target. Exported because the E2E lane
 * asserts against it rather than re-typing the string — `motir-core` uses the
 * same value, which is what makes the two shells' keyboard journeys identical.

   * WHICH HOST THIS PAGE IS BEING SERVED ON — required, never defaulted
   * (MOTIR-4372).
   *
   * The chrome carries links to `/explore`, `/docs`, `/design` and `/legal`,
   * which exist on `motir.co` alone; the same chrome is worn by every tenant
   * host, where all four are 404s. `SiteHeader` and `SiteFooter` therefore spell
   * them through `siteLinkFor`, and this is where that value enters.
   *
   * ⚠️ NO DEFAULT, DELIBERATELY, and `lib/publicHost.ts`'s own header says why:
   * *"a component whose output depends on a value it did not receive is a
   * component whose test can pass while the page is wrong"*. A `= SITE_HOST`
   * here would make the bug this card fixes reachable again by the exact route
   * that produced it — a surface added later that never thought about the host —
   * and it would fail silently, on somebody else's domain. Passing `SITE_HOST`
   * explicitly is one import and makes the claim readable at the call site.
   *
   * ⚠️ AND IT IS A PROP RATHER THAN AN AMBIENT `requestPublicHost()` READ. This
   * shell wraps `motir.co`'s statically rendered pages — the landing, `/legal`,
   * `/docs` — and `headers()` inside it would make every one of them dynamic to
   * answer a question only the `/p/**` tree and `/w` ever need asked.
