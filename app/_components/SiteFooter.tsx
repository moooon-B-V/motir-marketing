 * The footer — the `ExploreFooter` four-column shape: the brand column plus
 * Product / Resources / Legal, then the legal strip.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY ITEM HERE RESOLVES, AND THE ONES THAT DO NOT ARE ABSENT RATHER THAN
 * DRAWN AS LABELS. The design asset's own footer sketches `Overview`,
 * `Pricing`, `Blog`, `About` and `Contact` as plain text for pages that do not
 * exist yet. This ships the rule the same asset applies ONE SECTION UP, where
 * it drops `Product` and `Pricing` from the nav because they "render as dead
 * text there and are simply absent here" — and it means the footer needs no
 * copy MOTIR-1144 did not write. When those pages land they arrive with their
 * own strings and their own links.
 *
 * MOTIR-1144's catalogue supplies exactly these nine items and three headings;
 * the mapping below spends all of them and invents none.
 */

/*
 * ⚠️ `site: true` MARKS A LINK TO ONE OF THIS SITE'S OWN PAGES, and it is the
 * whole of MOTIR-4372 down here. Every one of these five was a root-relative
 * path emitted identically on every host the chrome is worn on — and a tenant
 * host serves that workspace's projects and nothing else, so `/explore`,
 * `/docs` and all three legal paths were 404s in the footer of every customer's
 * page. `siteLinkFor` spells them absolutely off the site and leaves them
 * exactly as they are on it.
 *
 * The three that are NOT marked are already absolute and already on another
 * host — the two `APP_ORIGIN` doors and the GitHub repository — so there is
 * nothing per-host to decide about them.
