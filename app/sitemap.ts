/*
 * motir.co's sitemap (MOTIR-1154 · 8.3.7), served at `/sitemap.xml`.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEW HERE, AND NOT motir-core's. That repository has an `app/sitemap.ts`
 * of its own and this card must not touch it: it lists the APPLICATION's public
 * surface — every public project, its tabs, the square and its topic pages —
 * read from the database at request time, at `app.motir.co`. This one lists the
 * MARKETING site's, which is a different host with a different content set. The
 * "already shipped" inventory this card inherited is motir-core's; none of it
 * is reusable here.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO ENTRIES. It was one — the landing's own footer deliberately omits
 * Product, Pricing, Blog and About because those pages do not exist
 * (`design/marketing/design-notes.md`), and a sitemap listing URLs that 404 is
 * worse than a short one. The line above this one asked that "when a second
 * page lands it adds its line here, in the same change that adds the route";
 * MOTIR-1043 is that change and `/design` is that route. The rule is unchanged
 * and still binds the third page.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO LONGER STATIC — MOTIR-4118, and the note it replaces said the opposite.
 * It read: "STATIC, unlike motir-core's. That one is `force-dynamic` because it
 * reads a database the image build cannot reach (MOTIR-2490); this one reads a
 * build-time constant, so prerendering it is correct and costs nothing at
 * request time." That was true while every entry was a constant. This file now
 * also enumerates PUBLIC PROJECTS from motir-core's public index, which is a
 * network read — so it is `force-dynamic`, for the same reason motir-core's is
 * and not a different one. `SITE_ORIGIN` is still a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value baked
 * in by `next build`, so the URLs are the real ones either way.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS PER-HOST NOW (MOTIR-4222), AND THE RULE HAS ONE SENTENCE:
 * **a sitemap may only list URLs on its own host.** So this file lists exactly
 * the projects whose CANONICAL is the host being asked — `primaryHost` on the
 * index row is the field that says so — at the paths that host serves them at.
 * Three consequences, each of them the point rather than a side effect:
 *
 *   • a project whose primary moves to a customer domain DISAPPEARS from
 *     `motir.co/sitemap.xml` and appears in that domain's own;
 *   • a workspace subdomain's sitemap lists only that workspace's projects, at
 *     `/<identifier>` rather than `/p/<identifier>`;
 *   • a customer domain's lists ONE project's tabs, at the host's root.
 *
 * The STATIC entries — the landing, /explore, /docs, /legal — belong to
 * `motir.co` alone and are emitted only there. A tenant host is a project's
 * address, not a copy of the marketing site, and listing this site's pages in a
 * customer's sitemap would ask a crawler to attribute them to that host.
 *
 * ⚠️ A FAILED INDEX READ EMITS THE STATIC ENTRIES AND A 200. `loadAllPublicProjects`
 * never throws and returns what it has. A sitemap that briefly loses its project
 * pages is recoverable — a crawler re-reads it — while one that 500s is not:
 * search engines back off a sitemap that errors, and the whole site's crawl
 * budget goes with it. The project pages are also reachable from `/explore`,
 * which is itself in this list, so a short sitemap is a delay rather than a hole.
 */
/*
 * ⚠️ EVERY motir.co PAGE APPEARS ELEVEN TIMES (MOTIR-7956). The site is
 * served in eleven languages, each at its own address (English unprefixed, the
 * rest under `/<locale>/`), and a crawler is told about a language version the
 * same two ways it is told about a page: by the page's own `hreflang` set and
 * by this file. So each motir.co page — the static ones below, and a project
 * whose primary address is motir.co — is one entry per locale, and every one of
 * those entries carries the same twelve alternates (the eleven plus
 * `x-default`) the page's `<head>` does, spelled by the same helper
 * (`lib/localeMetadata.ts`), so the two cannot disagree. A tenant host is not
 * multiplied: one URL there serves every language by cookie and
 * `Accept-Language`, and an alternate can only name a distinct URL.
