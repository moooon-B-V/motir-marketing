/**
 * The legal-document shell (MOTIR-4009).
 *
 * The room is composed from the same chrome every motir.co surface wears —
 * `SiteHeader` + `SiteFooter` — so a legal page cannot drift from the rest of
 * the site. `/legal` marks NEITHER nav item current: the shipped header only
 * marks its one internal route (`/design`), and Explore / Docs stay cross-origin
 * until their own cards land.
 *
 * ── NO `loading.tsx` ANYWHERE IN THIS TREE, deliberately ────────────────────
 * `[slug]/page.tsx` calls `notFound()` for an unknown slug. A `loading.tsx`
 * above a route that decides existence flushes the response head and fixes the
 * status at 200, turning a 404 into a page that renders like one. The copy is
 * read from disk at build time, so there is nothing to suspend on anyway.
 *
 * ── NO database read, NO API call ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * These pages are files on disk. The reason the app host's shipped layout gives
 * still applies: a legal page that 500s because a database is unreachable is a
 * worse failure than a narrowed crawl surface.
 *
 * ── THE DOCUMENTS STAY ENGLISH, BY DECISION (MOTIR-4009, MOTIR-7740) ────────
 * The SURROUNDING chrome labels — the breadcrumb, the version line, the index
 * title and intro — are read through the page's locale (`getCopy`,
 * MOTIR-7950). The contract text itself is never translated: a non-English
 * page wraps the English document, and the binding-English note above it says
 * so in the reader's language and links to the English text
 * (`_components/BindingEnglishNote.tsx`, design
 * `design/legal/design-notes.md` § `legal--binding-english-note.*`). Search
 * engines are pointed at English too: every language version of a document is
 * canonical to the unprefixed English address (MOTIR-8086).
 */

/*
 * The words only, in the page's locale. This used to set `canonical: '/legal'`,
 * which every document under it inherited — so `/legal/privacy` told a crawler
 * its canonical was the index. Each page names its own now (MOTIR-7956).
