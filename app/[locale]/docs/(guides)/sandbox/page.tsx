/*
 * The sandbox guide (MOTIR-4046, WRITTEN by MOTIR-4392) — committed prose, per
 * `lib/docs.ts`'s carve-out: the guide / policy / MCP / CLI / sandbox pages are
 * AUTHORED documentation rather than a registry, which is why they are allowed
 * to live in this repository at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS CARD FIXED. The page was two sentences, zero `<code>` and zero
 * `<pre>`. Both sentences were accurate and neither was actionable: a reader
 * finished the page knowing what a sandbox IS and with no way to cause one to
 * exist. A definition is not a guide.
 *
 * ── Every claim below was READ off motir-core at `origin/main`, not restated ─
 * The card said in terms not to trust its own summary of these, and it was right
 * to: its summary of the grant was WRONG.
 *
 *   · the image, its tags and the profile list — `lib/apiDocs/sandbox.ts`
 *     (`SANDBOX_IMAGE`, `SANDBOX_CONTAINER_NAME`, `sandboxProfileRows()` derived
 *     from the CLI's own `AGENT_PROFILES`); the `docker pull` / `docker run`
 *     lines are what `sandboxPullCommand` / `sandboxRunCommand` emit for the
 *     `claude` profile, verbatim.
 *   · every command and flag — `packages/cli/src/commandCatalog.ts`.
 *   · the grant — `lib/mcp/toolPermissions.ts`'s `CLI_TOKEN_GRANT`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CARD'S OWN GRANT LIST WAS FALSIFIED, and this page carries the shipped
 * one. MOTIR-4392 states the grant as four keys — `project:browse`,
 * `work_item:edit`, `comment:add`, `ai:plan`. The constant on `origin/main`
 * carries SIX: `lesson:view` and `lesson:reinforce` were added deliberately, by
 * MOTIR-3480 and MOTIR-3553, each with its argument written at the line. The
 * half of the card's claim that matters is unchanged and TRUE: `ai:view_plan` is
 * absent, which is why a sandboxed run can open a plan and is refused on its
 * first append.
 *
 * ── The boundary with `/docs/cli` ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Commands are LINKED, never restated — one home per fact. This page owns the
 * environment a run executes inside; that page owns what you type.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THREE SECTIONS RESTORED (MOTIR-4429) ────────────────────────────────
 * MOTIR-4397's parity ledger found three things the deleted `motir-core` page
 * at `95a2d4468^` (`lib/apiDocs/sandbox.ts`) carried and this one did not:
 *
 *  1. **What it confines — and what it does not.** The most important of the
 *     three, and the one nobody measured: the page opened by saying an agent
 *     "reaches your work tree and not the rest of your machine" while the
 *     original said in terms that the NETWORK is open by design. A confinement
 *     claim with its exception deleted is not a smaller claim, it is a
 *     different and false one — so this is a correction as much as a restore.
 *     `Network` and `unprivileged` both appeared ZERO times here.
 *  2. **Before you start.** The Docker prerequisite, the `linux/arm64` fact
 *     (Apple Silicon is native; nothing is emulated), the agent sign-in that
 *     must exist on the host, and the folder tree showing that you mount the
 *     directory CONTAINING your checkouts. The page had compressed the last of
 *     these to one clause and dropped the rest.
 *  3. **Or start it from VS Code instead.** `devcontainer` and `VS Code` both
 *     appeared ZERO times, and the page's closing paragraph listed the editor
 *     integrations as "not documented here yet" — a deletion recorded as a
 *     decision. It was neither: the original documented them.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE HEREDOC DELIMITER IS QUOTED — `<<'JSON'` — and that is load-bearing.
 * Unquoted, the shell expands `${localWorkspaceFolder}` and `${localEnv:HOME}`
 * to empty strings on the way into the file, and the reader gets a container
 * that mounts nothing and finds no credential: a silent failure strictly worse
 * than being stuck. `tests/docs/sandbox.test.tsx` greps for the quoted form
 * rather than trusting review, which is what the deleted module did too.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE `postStartCommand` LINE IS TRANSCRIBED, NOT INVENTED (MOTIR-4961).
 * `overrideCommand: true` makes Dev Containers replace the image's ENTRYPOINT
 * as well as its CMD, so this route ran none of the container's own setup and
 * an agent started here had no writable config directory to sign in to — the
 * `docker run` recipe on this same page worked and this one could not, while
 * the page offered them as equals (MOTIR-4956). The string is copied VERBATIM
 * from the recipe motir-core ships, read at `lib/apiDocs/sandbox.ts`'s
 * `SANDBOX_DEVCONTAINER_JSON`; it is deliberately not derived at build time,
 * for the same reason every other claim on this page is transcribed rather than
 * imported across a repository boundary. The `|| true` is part of the literal:
 * it keeps an older pinned `:<profile>-<version>` image, which has no such
 * command, starting rather than erroring.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND ONE OBJECT, TWO BLOCKS. The listing and the heredoc are built from
 * `DEVCONTAINER_JSON`, so a `mounts` entry corrected in one cannot publish a
 * different config under the other caption.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE OPENING SENTENCE SAID "a coding agent" (MOTIR-4508). Motir's agents do
 * design, decision, content, test and code work — the sandbox runs an agent, not
 * specifically a coding one, and the narrower word sells a narrower product on
 * the page a developer reads immediately before deciding whether to run it. It
 * now reads "your own agent", which is how the next sentence already writes it.
 * `tests/copy.test.ts` bans the phrase and could not see this one: it walks the
 * copy CATALOGUE, and this is JSX prose. `tests/docs/terminology.test.tsx` is
 * the surface-correct guard — it runs the same three predicates over what every
 * `/docs` page RENDERS, which is also the only kind that can see a phrase JSX
 * has line-wrapped, as this one was.
 *
 * ── THE PROSE LIVES IN `content/docs/sandbox/<locale>.md` (MOTIR-8056) ─────
 * Every sentence this file and `SetupSteps.tsx` used to carry is in the
 * document, so a translation can reach it. What stays here is what a reader
 * copies or a profile decides: the two illustrative blocks below, the commands
 * and dev-container JSON in `lib/sandboxProfiles.ts`, and the values the prose
 * must not restate (the volume name, the two docker command names, the sign-out
 * command). The document's parts: `body` is the opening and the preconditions;
 * the picker, chip, step, note and `devcontainer-file` parts are the text of
 * `SetupSteps`, a client component that cannot read a document itself, so they
 * cross as rendered nodes; `why` is everything from 'Why it looks like this' on.
 * The document is resolved ONCE, so a stale translation falls back as a whole.
 *
 * A heading had no id before this card (the page used none); each now carries
 * one in the document, which a translated heading keeps.
