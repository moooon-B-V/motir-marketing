/*
 * The SENTRY guide (MOTIR-6007) — committed prose, for the person connecting
 * their team's Sentry organisation to a Motir project, and for Sentry's own
 * reviewers, who read it during publication review (MOTIR-6004).
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY LABEL IS COPIED FROM THE PRODUCT, NOT FROM MEMORY. The button,
 * switch and status names below are motir-core's shipped `monitoring.*` strings
 * (`messages/en.json`). A guide naming a control the screen does not have sends
 * a reader looking for it; when the product's wording changes, this page does.
 *
 * ⚠️ SENTRY'S "ISSUES" ARE CALLED ERRORS HERE, ON PURPOSE. `issue` is a banned
 * word on every docs page (`tests/docs/terminology.test.tsx`): in Motir the unit
 * of work is a work item, and the rule has no exemption for another product's
 * vocabulary. So a Sentry issue is "an error" throughout, and the permissions
 * are named by Sentry's own scope identifiers rather than by the label Sentry
 * groups them under.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO NUMBERS THAT LIVE ELSEWHERE. The check interval and Sentry's token
 * lifetime are the product's and Sentry's to change; the page says what happens,
 * not how often.
