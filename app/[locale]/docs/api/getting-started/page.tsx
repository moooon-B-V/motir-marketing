/*
 * The getting-started guide (MOTIR-4046, RESTORED by MOTIR-4429).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS CARD FIXED. The page was five prose bullets — `0 <pre>` blocks
 * and ZERO occurrences of `curl`. A page titled *Getting started* that contains
 * no request a reader can run has exactly the defect MOTIR-4391 removed from
 * the reference beside it. The deleted `motir-core` page at `95a2d4468^`
 * (`lib/apiDocs/guide.ts`) was a hands-on walkthrough: a first call and its
 * `200` body, two paginated calls and both bodies, a `404` body, and the
 * response headers read back. MOTIR-4397's parity ledger measured the loss;
 * this is the restore, and the five steps it was reduced to are kept as the
 * spine rather than replaced.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY REQUEST IS BUILT FROM THE CONFIGURED ORIGIN, never from a literal.
 * `lib/appOrigin.ts` is the one place the motir-core origin lives, so a preview
 * build prints requests against the preview it is part of.
 * `tests/docs/apiGuide.test.tsx` asserts every rendered `curl` carries it — a
 * hard-coded `https://app.motir.co` fails there rather than silently pointing a
 * reader at production from a preview.
 *
 * ── What the RESPONSE bodies are, said plainly ─────────────────────────────
 * Authored illustrations of the documented shapes, elided with `…` where a real
 * body is long — the same treatment the deleted page used. They are not fetched
 * and they are not generated: nothing in this repository can make an
 * authenticated call, and the SHAPES are what a reader needs. What IS derived is
 * the operation set beside them — `/docs/api` renders the served OpenAPI
 * document — so the contract itself is never described from memory here.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE ONE NUMBER IN THE HEADER BLOCK IS DERIVED TOO. The deleted page
 * interpolated motir-core's `V1_CONTRACT_VERSION`, which this repository cannot
 * import — so the version comes from the served document's `info.version`, read
 * through the SAME memoized fetch `app/docs/api/layout.tsx` already makes for
 * the rail. That is one document per request, not two, and it is why a typed
 * literal was not the cheaper option: a committed version is stale exactly when
 * it is displayed, which is the copy MOTIR-4180 removed from this repository.
 * Unreachable ⇒ the block shows a PLACEHOLDER and the surrounding paragraph
 * says how to read the real one; it never shows a number that might be wrong.
