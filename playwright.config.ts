/**
 * THE BROWSER LANE (MOTIR-4112) — this repository's first.
 *
 * `vitest.config.mts` runs jsdom and `vitest.design.config.mts` drives a
 * headless chromium over `.mock.html` FILES. Neither loads the application: the
 * first cannot, and the second is a measuring instrument for design assets
 * rather than a test harness. This config is what lets a spec walk the site the
 * way a visitor does.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THE BUILD IS PART OF THE `webServer` COMMAND, AND HAS TO BE ────────
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOTIR_APP_ORIGIN` is inlined by `next build`, so pointing the app
 * at the stub is a BUILD-time act — setting the variable when starting an
 * already-built server changes nothing, because the literal is in the bundle.
 * `lib/appOrigin.ts` explains why it works that way and throws at import when
 * the variable is unset, which is the guard that turns this from a silent
 * mis-point into a failed build. So the command below builds and then starts,
 * with the origin set for both.
 *
 * The cost is honest and worth naming: this lane builds the app. It is why the
 * job has its own timeout in `ci.yml` and why it is a separate job rather than
 * a step inside `test`.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ NO ACCEPTANCE-VIDEO WORKFLOW — READ THIS BEFORE ADDING ONE ─────────
 *
 * MOTIR-4112 was authored on 2026-09-01 asking for a workflow mirroring
 * `motir-core`'s `.github/workflows/acceptance-video.yml` and its
 * `.github/actions/upload-acceptance-video` composite. **Both were DELETED from
 * `motir-core` on 2026-09-02** by MOTIR-4096, nineteen hours later:
 * `docs/decisions/acceptance-video.md`'s amendment of that date records the
 * decision as "CI NO LONGER UPLOADS THE RECORDING. THE AGENT PUBLISHES IT, over
 * the Motir MCP surface", and retires the uploader script, the composite action,
 * the `id-token: write` grant and the `MOTIR_UPLOAD_TOKEN` secret with it — on
 * the stated ground that "a credential with no consumer is one nobody thinks
 * about when deciding whether to rotate it".
 *
 * Mirroring the retired shape here would re-introduce, in a second repository,
 * exactly what that decision had just removed from the first — including the
 * credential. So this lane does the half the decision KEPT: it RECORDS. `video`
 * and `trace` are on, the artefacts land in the report, and the agent that runs
 * the acceptance spec publishes the clip onto the card itself (`attach_file` on
 * the MCP surface, which asserts `work_item:edit` — a key a dispatched run
 * already holds). `nextjs-prisma-vercel-starter` is having its copy retired the
 * same way under MOTIR-4097; this repository never grew one.
 *
 * ⚠️ CONSEQUENCE, STATED SO IT IS NOT REDISCOVERED: this lane needs NO new
 * environment variable and NO new secret. The card's provisioning clause is
 * therefore discharged by there being nothing to provision — not deferred.
