// THE LANE'S SUBJECT (MOTIR-4112).
//
// One spec, deliberately small, and it exists so the job cannot be
// green-because-empty. The `/p/*` walk is MOTIR-4122's; what is asserted here is
// that the harness itself works end to end — the app builds against the stub,
// starts, serves a document, and the stub answers the reads a server component
// makes before the browser has anything to render.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY WAIT IS ON AN AUTHORITATIVE SIGNAL — a response, a URL, a rendered
// landmark — never a timeout. That is `motir-core/CLAUDE.md`'s E2E discipline
// and it applies to this repository from its first spec rather than from the
// first flake.

}) => {
  // The half a `page.route()` stub could never reach: `lib/explore.ts` fetches
  // from a SERVER component, so this assertion passing is the proof that the
  // build was pointed at the stub rather than at app.motir.co.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE ASSERTION IS ON THE SECOND FIXTURE, NOT THE FIRST, and deliberately.
  // "Motir" appears in the page's own heading, its banner and its footer, so a
  // spec asserting it would pass with the API unreachable and the empty state
  // rendered — the exact failure this spec exists to catch. "Acme Inc" appears
  // nowhere on this site except in a card built from the fixture.

  // The stub's own contract, asserted once. An unfixtured path answers 404 with
  // `STUB_NO_FIXTURE`, so a spec that renders an empty state because the stub
  // was never taught a route can be told apart from one rendering an empty
  // state because the product does. Checked at the stub rather than through a
  // page, because the point is the stub's behaviour.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE ORIGIN IS IMPORTED, NEVER READ FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. This line used
  // to be `process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_MOTIR_APP_ORIGIN'] ?? <the stub>`, which
  // resolved to the stub locally and to PRODUCTION in CI — `ci.yml` sets that
  // variable at workflow level. See `e2e/stub/origin.ts`.
