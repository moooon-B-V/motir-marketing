/*
 * THE CHROME ON A TENANT HOST (MOTIR-4372) — the half no jsdom test can reach.
 *
 * `tests/host/chromeLinks.test.tsx` asks the DOM what the chrome EMITS on each
 * host kind. This asks a browser what the network actually DID, which is the
 * only place two of the card's criteria live:
 *
 *   • A 404 is a property of a request, not of a string. The bug's own evidence
 *     was `hey.motir.site/explore → 404`, and nothing that renders markup can
 *     observe that.
 *   • The costly half was never a click at all. `/explore`, `/docs` and
 *     `/design` were same-origin `next/link`s, so Next RSC-PREFETCHED all three
 *     ON RENDER — three 404s per tenant page load, before the visitor touched
 *     anything. A prefetch is invisible in the DOM and invisible in a snapshot;
 *     it exists only as a request.
 *
 * ⚠️ ASSERTED AS A COUNT, NOT AS THE ABSENCE OF THREE URLS — the card says so in
 * terms, and it is the difference between a guard and a fixture. A fourth site
 * link added to the chrome next year is covered by these assertions the day it
 * is added; a list of three would report green about it for ever.

 * could answer did. These two could not: `proxy.ts` reached them through a
 * `rewriteTo` helper that forwarded no headers at all, so the page was told it
 * was on `motir.co` and was right to believe it. The reproduction on the live
 * deployment was `hey.motir.site/explore` — a 404 room offering six doors, all
 * six of them 404s where the visitor was standing.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE ROOM'S OWN DOORS ARE THE HALF THE TESTS ABOVE CANNOT SEE.
 * `Explore projects` and `Go to the homepage` live inside `<main>`, not in the
 * chrome, and they were the two links a lost visitor is most likely to click —
 * so `hrefsOf` is read over the WHOLE document here rather than over the bar
 * and the footer alone.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE TWO SURFACES ANSWER FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, and the assertions cannot
 * tell them apart — which is the point. `/host-unavailable` is an ordinary
 * route and READS the request, so it knows it is on an `unresolved` host. The
 * 404 room may not read anything: `app/not-found.tsx` is the GLOBAL not-found
 * boundary, so a `headers()` read there makes the entire site dynamic
 * (measured). It links absolutely on every host instead. Both end up emitting
 * the same thing, and this spec asks for the emission rather than the mechanism.
 *
 * The base-domain branch (`host === TENANT_DOMAIN`) has no instance in this
 * lane, and that is a property of the lane rather than a gap: the configured
 * base domain here is `localhost`, which the router steps aside for as a LOCAL
 * host before it ever reaches that branch. `tests/host/hostRouter.test.ts`
 * covers it against the production value, with the base domain stubbed for
 * exactly that reason.
