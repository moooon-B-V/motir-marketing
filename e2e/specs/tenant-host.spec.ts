/*
 * THE TENANT HOST, IN A REAL BROWSER (MOTIR-4220's fifth criterion).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS SPEC IS FOR, said plainly: it proves the HARNESS is reachable.
 * The card asks for "a spec that walks `acme.localhost:<port>`… proving the
 * tenant-host harness is reachable", and that is a real deliverable rather than
 * a token one — `e2e/specs/acceptance-public-project.spec.ts` and MOTIR-4226's
 * work both need a tenant host to walk, and until one request has actually
 * arrived on `acme.localhost` with the router in the loop, nobody knows whether
 * the lane CAN address a second host at all. The routing logic itself is
 * covered exhaustively in `tests/host/`, over a stubbed contract; this is the
 * half those cannot do — the `Host` header a real browser sends, the rewrite
 * Next actually performs, and the status code on the wire.
 *
 * Every wait is on an authoritative signal, per the lane's discipline.
