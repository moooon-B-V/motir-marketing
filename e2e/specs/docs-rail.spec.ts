/*
 * THE DOCS RAIL'S BOX, MEASURED (MOTIR-4432).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS IS IN THE BROWSER LANE AND NOT BESIDE `tests/docs/docsRail.test.tsx`.
 * That file covers the rail thoroughly — the tiers, the filter, the count line,
 * `aria-current`, the narrow disclosure — and it could not have caught the
 * defect this spec exists for, because jsdom computes no layout: every
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` there is zeroes, so a height comparison reads
 * `0 === 0` and passes on any markup at all. The only assertion available in
 * that lane is a class-name one, and a class-name assertion for an ABSENT class
 * (`items-start`) passes on markup that never had it — it agrees with the fix
 * and with a rail deleted outright. So the guard has to run somewhere boxes
 * exist, which is here.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IT GUARDS, AND WHY IT TAKES TWO ASSERTIONS RATHER THAN ONE.
 * The rail has two jobs that cannot live on one element, and each one-element
 * arrangement breaks the other:
 *
 *   - `align-items: start` on the shell's grid shrinks the rail to its own rows,
 *     which is what makes `position: sticky` engage — and it ends the tint and
 *     the right border where the rows end. Shipped state before this card: 283px
 *     of rail against a 931px reading column on `/docs`, and 900px against
 *     86400px on `/docs/api`.
 *   - Deleting `align-items: start` and leaving the sticky where it was gives a
 *     full-height rail whose sticky never engages — measured at `top: -260` after
 *     a 600px scroll. The rail scrolls away, which is the defect the class was
 *     added to prevent.
 *
 * A spec that asserted only the first would go green on the second arrangement,
 * which is the cheapest wrong fix available and the one a reader reaches for.
 * Both are asserted for that reason.
 *
 * `/docs` is the page under test because it is the cheapest instance the defect
 * appears on: no operation tier, no upstream fetch (the guides route group
 * performs none — `app/docs/(guides)/layout.tsx`), and a reading column three
 * times the rail's own height.

 * accessible name, so the other two are reached from it — and the walk asserts
 * what it found rather than trusting it, so a future re-shuffle of the shell
 * fails loudly here instead of quietly measuring the wrong element.

 * THE SHORT PAGE (MOTIR-4465) — the case the block above is STRUCTURALLY
 * unable to reach, and it is not an oversight to widen it into: it is a
 * SECOND defect that the first one's instrument could not see.
 *
 * `MOTIR-4432` measured the rail against the READING COLUMN, and both tests
 * above are that measurement. On `/docs/mcp` the rail equals its column
 * exactly — 359px against 359px — so the card recorded the defect as
 * "invisible there" and the premise assertion in the first test
 * (`column.height - inner.height > 200`) excludes the route by construction.
 * What neither measurement asks is whether the rail reaches the FOOTER, and
 * on a page shorter than the viewport it does not: the docs grid takes its
 * height from its content while the `main` landmark around it stretches, so
 * the tint ends 224px above the footer and the sidebar reads as a stub.
 *
 * Hence a different pair of boxes — the rail and the FOOTER — and a premise
 * that pins the case rather than excluding it: the page must not scroll.

/**
 * The `/docs` route whose whole page fits inside {@link SHORT_VIEWPORT}.
 *
 * ⚠️ RE-POINTED BY MOTIR-4429, EXACTLY AS THE NOTE BELOW ANTICIPATED — and the
 * viewport moved with it, which the note did not anticipate and which is the
 * part worth reading.
 *
 * ~~The one `/docs` route whose whole page is shorter than a 1440×900 viewport.
 * It is SHORT because its content is thin, which is a property of the page and
 * not of the shell — `MOTIR-4429` restores this page's client-wiring guide, and
 * on the day that lands this route stops being the instance. The premise
 * assertion below is what makes that a RED test rather than a silent pass: a
 * route that no longer satisfies "the page does not scroll" fails here and says
 * so, and the fix is to point this constant at whichever route is then the
 * short one — never to delete the case.~~
 *
 * That day is this one. `/docs/mcp` went from 359px of grid to a full wiring
 * guide, and the premise assertion did what it was written to do. **What the
 * note assumed was that some other route would be short at 900, and after
 * MOTIR-4429 none is** — measured at 1440×900 on that branch: `/docs` 1248,
 * `/docs/api/stability` 1849, `/docs/public-address` 3255, and every other
 * route further away.
 *
 * So the case is kept by moving the OTHER term. "Shorter than the viewport" is
 * a relation between a page and a window, and the window is a test parameter
 * while the page is the product — {@link SHORT_VIEWPORT} is tall enough that
 * the shortest route is genuinely short in it, and the premise below still
 * asserts that rather than assuming it. Deleting the case was never an option:
 * it is the only thing standing between the shipped layout and MOTIR-4465's
 * defect, a rail that stops 224px above the footer on a page the viewport does
 * not fill.
