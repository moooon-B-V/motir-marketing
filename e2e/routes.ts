/**
 * EVERY ROUTE THIS SITE SERVES, AND ONE CONCRETE URL FOR EACH (MOTIR-4169).
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THIS FILE IS A LIST, AND THAT IS SAFE ONLY BECAUSE A TEST ENUMERATES ─
 *
 * MOTIR-4169 asks for the landmark assertion to ENUMERATE the routes rather
 * than list them, "so a page added later cannot ship without one" — and a
 * browser cannot enumerate a route tree: a dynamic segment has no URL until
 * somebody supplies a parameter the stub can answer, so a spec that walked
 * `app/**` would have to invent `/explore/topic/undefined`.
 *
 * The enumeration therefore lives one lane over, in
 * `tests/mainLandmark.test.ts`, and it enumerates `app/**​/page.tsx` from disk
 * and asserts that the pattern set below is EXACTLY that set — no missing
 * entry, no stale one. So a thirteenth page turns the `test` job red until it
 * appears here, and appearing here is what puts it in the browser lane's walk.
 * The list is the E2E lane's parameter table; the enumeration is the guard.
 *
 * ⚠️ SO THE 404 IS NOT IN THIS TABLE, AND MUST NOT BE ADDED TO IT
 * (MOTIR-4193). `app/not-found.tsx` is not a `page.tsx` and serves no route
 * pattern, so a row for it would fail the very assertion above — the pattern
 * set here must be EXACTLY the enumerated one. The 404 has its own entry in
 * the lane instead: `e2e/specs/not-found.spec.ts`, which walks the four
 * arrivals that reach it and asserts the STATUS as well as the landmark count.
 *
 * ── THE URLS THE STUB CAN ANSWER ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every `/p/*` URL uses `MOTIR`, the identifier `e2e/stub/publicApiStub.ts`
 * has fixtures for, and the two detail pages use the keys its `ROUTES` table
 * names. A URL this stub has no fixture for answers `STUB_NO_FIXTURE` and the
 * page renders its own not-found — which would pass a landmark assertion while
 * proving nothing about the route, so the pairing matters.
