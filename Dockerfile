# motir-marketing on Fly.io — the production image (MOTIR-1455).
#
# Modelled on motir-core's Dockerfile, minus everything that repo needs and this
# one does not: no Prisma, no migration lane, no worker process group, no
# design-system workspace build. What is kept is the shape the host decided —
# `output: 'standalone'`, one long-running Node process, HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 —
# per `motir-core/docs/decisions/marketing-site-hosting.md` Q1.

# ⚠️ A BUILD ARG, NOT A FLY SECRET, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT A PREFERENCE.
# `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is INLINED by `next build`, so this value has to exist HERE,
# in the builder stage — a Fly secret is a runtime environment variable and
# arrives hours too late, after an image has already been built with the doors
# pointing at `undefined`. `fly.toml`'s `[build.args]` is what supplies it on a
# release; `.env.example` documents it for local development.
#
# Deliberately NO DEFAULT. `lib/appOrigin.ts` throws when it is unset, which
# fails this layer with the variable's name — the one moment the mistake is
# cheap. A default here would make that guard unreachable and let a
# misconfigured deployment ship a landing page whose every button leads to a
# domain that is not serving (MOTIR-1152, acceptance criterion 4).

# The tenant namespace's base domain (MOTIR-4220). Same reasoning as the origin
# above — inlined by `next build`, so it has to arrive as a build ARG — and
# `lib/tenantDomain.ts` fails the build when it is missing here, which is the
# only moment the mistake is cheap. Its value travels in `fly.toml`'s
# `[build.args]`.
