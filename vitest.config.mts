 * before its job exists"; this is that job's other half, and `ci.yml` gains
 * both together.
 *
 * ⚠️ `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOTIR_APP_ORIGIN` IS SET HERE, and it is set to a value that
 * is NOT production on purpose. Every module that reaches `lib/destinations.ts`
 * imports `lib/appOrigin.ts`, which throws when the variable is missing — so
 * without this the whole suite would fail to import. A non-production value is
 * what lets `tests/destinations.test.ts` assert that the doors are BUILT from
 * the variable rather than merely equal to the string somebody expected.
 *
 * `tests/appOrigin.test.ts` is the one file that must see the variable ABSENT.
 * It re-imports the module under a stubbed environment rather than relying on
 * this default, which is why the default here does not weaken it.

     * MOTIR-4120 found on the other side of this story: the sibling entry there
     * was a literal path, so five new route files inherited no floor at all and
     * the gate was green because it was measuring nothing. Adding a `/p/*` file
     * without adding it here reproduces that, so the list is checked by a test.
