/**
 * The BASE DOMAIN of the tenant namespace — `motir.site` in production
 * (Story MOTIR-3878 · MOTIR-4220).
 *
 * A workspace claims a label under it (`acme.motir.site`), so this is the
 * suffix every tenant subdomain is built on. `motir-core` has the same accessor
 * on its side of the seam (`lib/publicAddresses/tenantDomain.ts`) reading
 * `MOTIR_PUBLIC_TENANT_DOMAIN`; this one is the RENDERER's half, and the names
 * differ on purpose — the value is inlined into a client bundle here, so it
 * carries the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix that says so.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ WHY THE ROUTER NEEDS IT AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The base domain itself is NOT a tenant address. `motir.site` has no row, so
 * the contract 404s it — but answering here means the answer does not depend on
 * the ABSENCE of a row somebody could one day create, and it saves a network
 * hop on a host we already know the answer for. `motir-core`'s `resolveHost`
 * refuses it for the same stated reason; this is that refusal moved one hop
 * earlier, to the only place that can act on it without asking.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ IT THROWS IN PRODUCTION AND DEFAULTS EVERYWHERE ELSE ──────────────
 *
 * The two existing origin modules sit at opposite ends of this and neither one
 * is right here. `lib/appOrigin.ts` throws unconditionally — correct for
 * "somebody else's origin", where a wrong guess ships dead doors. It would be
 * wrong here: it would make `pnpm test` and `next dev` need configuration to
 * run at all, for a variable a local run has no true value for.
 * `lib/siteOrigin.ts` defaults unconditionally — correct for a value with one
 * right answer that is not a secret. It would be wrong here too: a production
 * build that silently took `localhost` as its tenant namespace would treat the
 * real base domain as an unknown tenant host and 404 it, and nothing would go
 * red.
 *
 * So: a DEV/TEST default, and a production build that fails with the variable's
 * name. `localhost` is the honest default rather than a placeholder — in a local
 * run and in the browser lane the tenant namespace really is `*.localhost`
 * (Chromium resolves every label under it to loopback), so `acme.localhost` is a
 * working tenant host with no configuration and no `/etc/hosts` edit.
 *
 * ⚠️ `NEXT_PUBLIC_` BECAUSE IT IS READ AT BUILD TIME, exactly as the two
 * origins are: it travels in `fly.toml`'s `[build.args]` and the `Dockerfile`'s
 * `ARG`, and a Fly SECRET would arrive after the image that needed it already
 * existed.
