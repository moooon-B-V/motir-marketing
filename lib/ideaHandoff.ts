 *
 *   POST /api/idea-draft  { "idea": string }   →  201 { "draftId": string }
 *   then navigate to  `${origin}/sign-in?draft=<draftId>`
 *
 * The idea travels as a DRAFT ID and never as a query parameter — the receiver
 * stores it server-side and `/sign-in` claims it into the `motir_pending_idea`
 * cookie, which is what survives the OAuth round trip and the email-verification
 * bounce into the `/onboarding` entrance's carried panel.
 *
 * Pure and free of the DOM so the states it drives can be asserted directly;
 * the component owns only what it does with the result.
