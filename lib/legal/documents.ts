/**
 * The legal-document loader — a PORT of motir-core's `lib/legal/documents.ts`
 * (MOTIR-1134), moved into `motir-marketing` with the documents it reads
 * (MOTIR-4009). The parser and comparator are exported PURE so their tests
 * travel with them; only `LEGAL_DIR` changed.
 *
 * `content/legal/*.md` holds the published legal set. This module is the ONE
 * place that reads it, so the routes, the index and the footer all agree about
 * which documents exist and what each one is called.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THE DIRECTORY IS THE REGISTRY, and that is the whole design ──────────
 * Nothing here enumerates slugs. A document ships by EXISTING and no route
 * table has to be edited to add one. That is not tidiness, it is a defect the
 * source story already hit: the card was written for SIX documents, and a
 * hardcoded list of six would have shipped a subprocessor page linking to a
 * 404. The set has grown during the source story alone, so the cost of a list
 * is paid repeatedly and the cost of a glob is paid once.
 *
 * ── Front matter is parsed here rather than by a dependency ─────────────────
 * The shape is fixed and tiny — five scalar keys, no nesting, no arrays — and
 * this repository has no YAML parser. Adding one would be a new dependency and
 * a new thing to keep current, for a grammar this file handles in fifteen
 * lines. (This is the same reason the source repo wrote it by hand.)

 *
 * - a BARE PATH (`/settings/account/data`) is what shipped, and it is a 404.
 *   It was written while these documents lived on `app.motir.co`, where it
 *   resolved; the port to `motir.co` (MOTIR-4009) carried them byte for byte,
 *   which is exactly what that card asked for, and this link was the one line
 *   that needed editing precisely BECAUSE the host changed under it.
 * - a HARDCODED ORIGIN (`https://app.motir.co/...`) is the failure
 *   `lib/appOrigin.ts` exists to prevent: it works perfectly in production and
 *   silently points a preview build's readers at production data.
 *
 * So the document names a DESTINATION and this module resolves it, which is
