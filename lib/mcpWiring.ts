/**
 * WIRING A CLIENT TO THE MCP SERVER, AS DATA (MOTIR-4429).
 *
 * ── What was lost, and why it is coming back here ───────────────────────────
 * `motir-core` at `95a2d4468^` served this from `lib/apiDocs/mcp.ts` +
 * `app/(public)/docs/mcp/page.tsx` — a fork table, three numbered steps, five
 * ready-to-paste client blocks and a scope legend. The move to motir.co kept
 * the route and shipped two sentences: `mcpServers` appeared ZERO times across
 * all nine `/docs` pages, and `claude mcp add` zero times. A reader was told
 * the endpoint exists and given no way to reach it, on the page the whole
 * sub-area is named after. MOTIR-4397's parity ledger measured it; this is the
 * restore.
 *
 * ── EVERY BLOCK INTERPOLATES THE FACTS. Nothing here hard-codes a URL ───────
 * {@link mcpTransportFacts} resolves the four facts a client needs — the URL,
 * the transport, the header and the token shape — and every config below is
 * built from them. That is what makes the negative test meaningful: build the
 * blocks with a SENTINEL origin and assert every one carries it, and a block
 * that typed `https://app.motir.co` fails rather than passing by coincidence.
 * The origin comes from `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOTIR_APP_ORIGIN` (`lib/appOrigin.ts`), so
 * a preview build documents the preview it is part of.
 *
 * ── WHY THE PATH IS A LITERAL HERE, and what checks it ──────────────────────
 * `/api/mcp` is a stable public route, and this repository already hard-codes
 * the three sibling public paths it consumes — `/api/openapi/v1.json`,
 * `/api/docs/mcp-tools.json`, `/api/docs/cli-commands.json` — with
 * `tests/docs/docs.test.ts` asserting each literal is present rather than
 * fetched from somewhere. This follows that established shape. The durable
 * cross-repository check is `tests/seam/mcpEndpointSeam.test.ts`, which holds
 * this constant against the `endpoint` motir-core's own published catalogue
 * declares — in the seam lane, because a check that reaches app.motir.co may
 * not run on every pull request (`vitest.seam.config.mts`).
 *
 * ── ⚠️ WHY THE CLIENT BLOCKS LIVE IN A MODULE AND NOT IN THE PAGE ───────────
 * `tests/docs/docs.test.ts`'s tool-name detector scans
 * `app/docs/(guides)/mcp/page.tsx` for a lowercase underscore-joined identifier
 * — the shape every Motir MCP tool name has — because this repository cannot
 * check a tool name it types. Two VENDOR config keys have that same shape
 * (`mcp_servers` and `bearer_token_env_var`, both Codex CLI's TOML), so a page
 * that typed them would trip a guard that is right for a reason unrelated to
 * them. They are the vendor's spelling of its own file format, not a claim
 * about Motir's surface, and they belong beside the other four vendors'
 * spellings rather than inside the page. The guard stays literal, the page
 * stays clean, and this comment is the record of why.
 *
 * ── What is OURS and what is the VENDOR'S ───────────────────────────────────
 * Motir owns exactly the four transport facts. Everything else in a block —
 * the file path, the key names, the nesting, the secret mechanism — is that
 * vendor's, transcribed from that vendor's own documentation on
 * {@link MCP_CLIENT_FORMATS_CHECKED_ON}. So a stale block is wrong about a
 * vendor's syntax and never about Motir, which is why each one carries the
 * vendor's docs link and the date it was read.
