/**
 * THIS site's own public origin — the one motir.co is served from (MOTIR-1154).
 *
 * `lib/appOrigin.ts` answers "where does motir-core live?"; this answers "where
 * do I live?". They are different questions with different failure modes, which
 * is why they are different modules rather than one with two exports.
 *
 * Everything the entity signal emits is an ABSOLUTE URL — `metadataBase`, the
 * sitemap's entries, `robots`'s `sitemap:` line, and every `url` / `@id` in the
 * JSON-LD graph. A relative one is not merely less tidy: Next falls back to
 * `http://localhost:3000` for `metadataBase` and advertises the OpenGraph card
 * at an address no crawler, social-card renderer or link-preview fetcher can
 * reach (motir-core learned this as MOTIR-2505, on its own public surface).
 *
 * ⚠️ IT HAS A DEFAULT, AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE FROM `appOrigin`. That module
 * throws when its variable is unset, because there is no honest default for
 * "somebody else's origin" — a wrong guess ships dead doors. This one has
 * exactly one right answer in production and it is not a secret, so a default
 * is what keeps `next build`, `pnpm test` and a local `next dev` working with
 * no configuration at all. The override exists for a preview deployment that
 * wants its own canonicals; getting it wrong costs a canonical, not a door.
 *
 * ⚠️ `NEXT_PUBLIC_` BECAUSE IT IS READ AT BUILD TIME. Every consumer here is
 * statically rendered (root metadata, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`), so the value
 * is baked into the output by `next build` exactly as `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is —
 * setting it as a Fly SECRET would do nothing, for the same reason
 * `.env.example` already gives for the app origin. It travels in `fly.toml`'s
 * `[build.args]` if it is ever overridden.
