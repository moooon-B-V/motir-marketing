/**
 * The copy catalogue, read through the page's locale (MOTIR-7950).
 *
 * `messages/en.json` is the baseline and the type: every other locale is a
 * sibling `messages/<locale>.json` with the same key set, and this module turns
 * whatever that file holds into a complete `Copy` by taking English for every
 * key it lacks. A reader therefore never sees a raw key or `undefined`, and a
 * locale with no file at all renders wholly in English.
 *
 * ⚠️ STILL A TYPED OBJECT, NOT `t('…')`. The site reads `copy.landing.hero.cta`
 * and keeps reading it that way. next-intl is used for what a typed import
 * could not give: the request-scoped locale and the server/client handoff
 * (`useMessages`, `NextIntlClientProvider`). The English fallback lives in ONE
 * place, `resolveCopy`, on the server; the client receives the already-merged
 * object, so no component ever handles a missing key.
 *
 * Three ways to read it:
 *  • `useCopy()` — any component that is not `async`, server or client.
 *  • `await getCopy(locale)` — an `async` server component, with the locale
 *    from its `params` (`enterLocale`).
 *  • `englishCopy` — only page METADATA, the share image, the JSON-LD and the
 *    global 404, each of which another card localises.
 *    `tests/i18n/copyReaders.test.ts` holds that list.
