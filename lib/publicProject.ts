/**
 * The `/p/*` data layer for `motir-marketing` (MOTIR-4115).
 *
 * The public project pages moved out of `motir-core`, so this repository does
 * NOT read the database — it consumes motir-core's anonymous public contract.
 * This module owns every fetch that surface makes; the pages render its result.
 * No database client (the standing repo rule, asserted by a test).
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THE SHAPES BELOW ARE RESTATED, NOT IMPORTED, AND THAT IS THE SEAM ──
 *
 * They mirror `motir-core`'s `lib/dto/publicProjects.ts`. The CONTRACT is
 * guarded in the PRODUCING repository — `docs/decisions/public-surface-hosts.md`
 * §3 and its `tests/api/public/contract-drift.test.ts` — because, as §3 puts it,
 * "a contract test that lives only in the consumer reports that motir-core broke
 * motir.co, after it has shipped". Nothing here asserts the contract. When a
 * shape changes, the guard that goes red is over there.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `lib/explore.ts` has a `failed` flag because its read has two outcomes: data,
 * or the API is unreachable. This surface has THREE, and conflating any two of
 * them is a visible product bug:
 *
 *   • `ok`        — the project exists and is public.
 *   • `not-found` — a `404 { code }` from the API. The project does not exist,
 *                   is not public, or the key is wrong. The page calls
 *                   `notFound()`.
 *   • `failed`    — the API did not answer, or answered 5xx. The project may
 *                   well exist. The page renders the ERROR state the design
 *                   draws (`design/public-projects/`, panel 12).
 *
 * Collapsing `failed` into `not-found` tells a visitor the project was deleted
 * every time motir-core restarts, which is the worse direction: a 404 is a
 * statement about the world, an error is a statement about us. Collapsing
 * `not-found` into `failed` hides real 404s from crawlers and keeps dead links
 * out of the index. `design/public-projects/design-notes.md` records the split.

 *      customer domain to a dead page.
 *   2. `motir.co/p/<identifier>/<tab>` is a valid address for the project on
 *      every host, and MOTIR-4222 carries it on to the project's PRIMARY
 *      address with a 301. So the visitor lands on the canonical address rather
 *      than on whichever alternate they happened to start from, which is what
