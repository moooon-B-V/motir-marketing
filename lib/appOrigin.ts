/**
 * The ONE configured motir-core origin every cross-origin door is built from
 * (MOTIR-1152, acceptance criterion 4).
 *
 * The three doors on this page all leave motir.co for motir-core, and that
 * origin differs between local, preview and production. Three literals is
 * three places to be wrong, and the failure is invisible everywhere except the
 * environment that matters: a hardcoded `app.motir.co` works perfectly in
 * production and silently points a preview build at production data.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS MODULE THROWS AT IMPORT TIME, DELIBERATELY. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is
 * inlined at BUILD time, so an unset variable cannot be detected at runtime —
 * by then the literal `undefined` is already baked into the bundle and the
 * doors are dead links a visitor discovers. Throwing here fails `next build`
 * with the name of the variable, which is the only moment the mistake is
 * cheap. `MotirAppOriginError` is asserted by `tests/appOrigin.test.ts`; the
 * criterion asks for a test rather than an inspection precisely because a
 * guard nobody exercises is a comment.
